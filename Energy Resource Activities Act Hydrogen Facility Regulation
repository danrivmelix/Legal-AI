Schedule 1

Definitions
1  In this Schedule:

"boundary", in relation to a hydrogen facility, means the boundary at which access to the facility operating area is controlled, under the security measures required under section 26 (2) [security] of the regulation;

"critical area" means an unshielded area of critical importance from which it is difficult or dangerous to evacuate people on short notice;

"remote area" means an area where people are, generally, present infrequently and in small numbers;

"sterile area" means an area in which there is no vegetation growth or combustible materials.

Determining thermal radiation flux
2  For the purposes of determining the allowable thermal radiation flux,

(a)solar radiation must be excluded,

(b)the normal flow rate is the flow rate that results from all operating modes within the hydrogen facility design intent, and

(c)the accidental flow rate is the highest flow rate that

(i)results from an uncontrolled or unplanned event, and

(ii)is the sum of the combined flow rates from all possible uncontrolled or unplanned scenarios that may occur simultaneously.

• Malicious equipment damage or tampering
• Liquid spill or gas release beyond site, potentially affecting persons, property or the environment	Level 3 incident	Level 2 incident	Level 2 incident	Level 1 incident	Level 1 incident
