Calculating adjusted annual income
15   (1)In this section:

"notice of assessment" or "notice of reassessment" means the notice of assessment or notice of reassessment issued to a person by the Canada Revenue Agency under the Income Tax Act (Canada);

"previous year" means the calendar year previous to the current calendar year.

(2)The adjusted annual income of an applicant's family unit is calculated as follows:

(a)by adding together the annual income of the applicant and the annual income of the applicant's spouse, if any, each calculated or determined under subsection (3) or (4), as applicable;

(b)by deducting from the total amount calculated under paragraph (a) any applicable amount under subsection (6).

(3)If a notice of assessment has been issued to an applicant or the applicant's spouse for either of the 2 calendar years before the current calendar year, for the purposes of subsection (2) (a), the annual income of the person is calculated by the following formula:

annual income = gross income — deductions
where
gross income	=	the amount of the person's income for the previous calendar year, or for the calendar year before the previous calendar year if a notice of assessment is not available for the person for the previous calendar year, as reported on line 15000 of one of the following:
(a)	the notice of reassessment issued to the person for the applicable calendar year;
(b)	if no notice of reassessment was issued to the person for the applicable calendar year, the notice of assessment issued to the person for the applicable calendar year;
deductions	=	the amount, if any, reported on line 14500 of the applicable notice of reassessment or notice of assessment.
(4)If a notice of assessment has not been issued to an applicant or the applicant's spouse for either of the 2 calendar years before the current calendar year, for the purposes of subsection (2) (a), the annual income of the person is the amount determined by the minister based on the information given to the minister under subsection (5).

(5)For the purposes of subsection (4), a person must give to the minister a statement, in the form required by the minister, attesting to the person's total income from all sources except social assistance payments, expressed in Canadian dollars, for the calendar year preceding the current calendar year.

(6)For the purposes of subsection (2) (b), the following amounts may be deducted, if applicable:

(a)$0, for the first dependant in a parent's family unit who is not a child with support needs;

(b)$2 000, for each additional dependant in the parent's family unit;

(b)in relation to an increase in income, the 12-month period beginning the month after the month in which the income increased.

(2)An applicant may request a review of income under this section if the income of the applicant or the applicant's spouse has decreased.

(3)An applicant must request a review under subsection (2) by giving to the minister a statement, in the form required by the minister, attesting to the estimated annual income, for the relevant period, of the person whose income has decreased.

(4)If the income of an applicant or the applicant's spouse has decreased, despite section 15 (3), the minister may determine the annual income of the person based on the information provided in the statement under subsection (3) of this section.

(5)On receipt of a request for review under subsection (2), if the minister is satisfied that the decrease in income of the person may result in an increase in the amount of child care benefit, despite section 15 (2), the minister must calculate the adjusted annual income of the applicant's family unit in accordance with the following formula:

adjusted annual income = (decreased annual income + other annual income) — applicable deductions
where
decreased annual income	=	for the person whose income has decreased, the lesser of the following:
(a)	the person's annual income as determined by the minister under subsection (4) of this section;
(b)	the person's annual income as calculated or determined under section 15 (3) or (4), as applicable;
other annual income	=	for the other person, the annual income of that person as calculated or determined under section 15 (3) or (4) or this section, as applicable;
applicable deductions	=	the total of all amounts that may be deducted under section 15 (6).
(6)If, after conducting a review requested under subsection (2), the minister is satisfied that the adjusted annual income of the applicant's family unit calculated under subsection (5) will result in an increase in the amount of child care benefit, the minister must redetermine the amount of the child care benefit under section 18 [amount of child care benefits] using the adjusted annual income calculated under subsection (5) of this section as the basis for that determination.

(7)If, under subsection (6), the minister determines that an applicant is eligible for an increase in the amount of the child care benefit, the increased amount of child care benefit may be paid as follows:

(a)in the case of an applicant in respect of whom a determination about eligibility of a child care benefit has not yet been made, from the first day of the month in which the applicant completes an application for the child care benefit;

(b)in any other case, despite section 20 (1), from the first day of the month after the month in which the income review was requested.

(8)Subsection (9) applies if

(a)an increased child care benefit is payable to or on behalf of an applicant as a result of a review under subsection (2),

(b)the income of the person that resulted in the request for review has since increased, and

(c)the adjusted annual income of the applicant's family unit was calculated under subsection (5) using the annual income of the person determined by the minister under subsection (4).

(9)If this subsection applies, the applicant must give to the minister a statement, in the form required by the minister, attesting to the estimated annual income, for the relevant period, of the person whose income has increased.

(10)On receipt of a statement under subsection (9) about the estimated annual income of an applicant or the applicant's spouse,

(a)despite section 15 (3), the minister may determine the annual income of that person based on the information provided in the statement, and

(b)if the minister is satisfied that the increase in income may result in a decrease in the amount of the child care benefit, the minister must, despite section 15 (2), calculate the adjusted annual income of the applicant's family unit in accordance with the following formula:

adjusted annual income = (increased annual income + other annual income) — applicable deductions
where
increased annual income	=	for the person whose income has increased, the lesser of the following:
(a)	the person's annual income as determined by the minister under paragraph (a) of this subsection;
(b)	the person's annual income as calculated or determined under section 15 (3) or (4), as applicable;
other annual income	=	for the other person, the annual income of the person as calculated or determined under section 15 (3) or (4) or this section, as applicable;
applicable deductions	=	the total of all amounts that may be deducted under section 15 (6).
(11)If the minister is satisfied that the adjusted annual income of the applicant's family unit calculated under subsection (10) (b) will result in a decrease in the amount of the child care benefit, the minister must redetermine the amount of the child care benefit under section 18 using the adjusted annual income calculated under subsection (10) (b) of this section as the basis for that determination.

Notice to applicant required
17   (1)The minister must give to an applicant written notice of the minister's decision about whether or not the application under section 9 [applications and eligibility for child care benefits] is approved.

(2)If the minister's decision results in a refusal to pay a child care benefit to or for the applicant, the minister's notice to the applicant must include the minister's reasons for the refusal.
