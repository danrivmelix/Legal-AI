"germination index",

(a)in relation to orchard seeds of a tree described in column 1 of Table 1 [Orchard Seeds] of Schedule 1, means the percentage specified in column 3 opposite that description, and

(b)in relation to wild seeds of a tree described in column 1 of Table 2 [Wild Seeds] of Schedule 1, means the percentage specified in column 3 opposite that description;

"listed price",

(a)in relation to orchard seeds of a tree described in column 1 of Table 1 [Orchard Seeds] of Schedule 1, means the price specified in column 2 opposite that description, and

(b)in relation to wild seeds of a tree described in column 1 of Table 2 [Wild Seeds] of Schedule 1, means the price specified in column 2 opposite that description;

"orchard seeds" means seeds collected from a seed orchard;

"seed" means a tree seed;

"seedlot" means seeds that are assembled as a lot for the purposes of registration in accordance with the standards established under section 169 [chief forester standards] of the Act;

"tested germination rate", in relation to a seedlot, means the percentage of seeds in the seedlot that are likely to germinate, as determined by the minister;

"upgrade", in relation to a seedlot, means to remove non-viable seeds;

"wild seeds" means seeds collected from a wild stand of trees.

Provision of seeds
2   (1)The minister may provide seeds to a person.

(2)Subject to sections 10 and 11 [exemptions], a person to whom seeds are provided under this section must pay to the government the price determined in accordance with the following formula:

Price = weight x unit price x germination adjustment
where
weight	=	the weight of the seeds, expressed in kilograms;
unit price	=	the unit price for the seeds specified under subsection (3) or (4) of this section, as applicable;
germination
adjustment	=	the germination adjustment for the seeds determined under subsection (5) of this section.
(3)Subject to subsection (4), the unit price for seeds is the following:

(a)the listed price for the seeds, if the seeds are

(i)orchard seeds collected from

(A)an orchard owned by the government, or

(B)an orchard that receives funding from the government under an agreement to provide seeds to the government, or

(ii)wild seeds collected before 2004;

(b)in any other case, the actual cost to the government of acquiring a kilogram of the seeds.

(4)The unit price for seeds referred to in subsection (3) (a) (i) (A) is 50% of the unit price specified under that subsection if the minister considers, having regard to the genetic quality of the seeds, that the volume of the trees grown from the seeds at the location where the seeds will be planted will not be more than 5% greater than the volume of trees of the same species growing in wild stands at that location.

(5)The germination adjustment for seeds is the following:

(a)if the tested germination rate of the relevant seedlot is less than the germination index for the tree from which that seedlot was collected, the quotient of the tested germination rate and the germination index;

(b)in any other case, one.

Provision of vegetative material
3   (1)The minister may provide vegetative material to a person in an amount that the minister considers will yield a number of seedlings requested by the person, having regard to

(2)Subject to subsection (3) and sections 10 and 11 [exemptions], a person to whom vegetative material is provided under this section must pay to the government $0.04 per seedling requested by the person.

(3)If the minister is satisfied that vegetative material initially provided to a person under this section is insufficient to yield the number of seedlings requested by the person, the minister may, without additional change, provide more vegetative material to the person in an amount that the minister considers will make up the insufficiency.
