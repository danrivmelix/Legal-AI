Excluded organization
2  Canadian Blood Services is excluded from the definition of "public sector organization" in section 1 of the Act.

How measurements of emissions are to be expressed
3  For the purposes of the Act, greenhouse gas emissions must be expressed in tonnes based on their carbon dioxide equivalencies and tonnes of each specific greenhouse gas listed in the Schedule.

PSO sources of greenhouse gas emissions
4   (1)In this section:

"building" includes a structure or other permanent improvement;

"equipment" includes components of an information technology system;

"indirect energy emissions", in relation to a public sector organization or the supply of a good or service, means greenhouse gas emissions specifically associated with the production of electricity, steam, heating or cooling that is consumed or used by the organization or supplier.

(2)Subject to subsection (3), the following greenhouse gas emissions are deemed to be PSO greenhouse gas emissions:

(a)direct emissions and indirect energy emissions from the heating, air conditioning and lighting of a building or portion of a building owned or leased by the public sector organization, other than the heating, air conditioning and lighting of a building that is leased to another public sector organization;

(b)direct emissions and indirect energy emissions from the operation of appliances, equipment and machinery, other than mobile combustion sources, owned or leased by the public sector organization;

(c)direct emissions from the operation of a vehicle or other mobile combustion source, other than a public transit or school bus owned or leased by the public sector organization;

(d)in relation to the Provincial government, direct emissions and indirect energy emissions from the supply of travel and accommodation services to a public official who is travelling on public business for which travel expenses and accommodation expenses are covered by the consolidated revenue fund;

(e)direct emissions from the production of office paper purchased by the public sector organization for use in its business.

(3)Greenhouse gas emissions from an electricity generating facility or electricity transmission equipment operated by the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority are not emissions for which that authority is deemed to be responsible under the Act.

[am. B.C. Regs. 272/2009, App. B, s. 1; 45/2024, s. 2.]

Additional reporting requirements
5  In addition to the requirements of the Act and this regulation relating to PSO greenhouse gas emissions, a public sector organization must determine and report greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the operation of a public transit bus or school bus that is owned or leased by the public sector organization.

How emissions and their levels are to be determined
6  A public sector organization must determine, report and verify greenhouse gas emissions in the manner and form specified by the director.

Emission offsets
7   (1)A public sector organization, other than the government, that is required to apply emission offsets in order to be carbon neutral must do so by requesting that the minister apply the emission offsets on behalf of the public sector organization.

(2)If the government is required to apply emission offsets in order to be carbon neutral, the minister must apply the emission offsets on behalf of the government.

(3)Subject to any directives of the Treasury Board, the minister may set the terms and conditions for the application of emission offsets on behalf of a public sector organization.
