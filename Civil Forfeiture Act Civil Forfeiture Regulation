[en. B.C. Reg. 5/2022, s. 1; am. B.C. Reg. 151/2024, Sch., s. 1.]

Part 1 — Proceeds of Unlawful Activity

Determination of equivalent value if increase in value
2   (1)The purpose of this section is to determine the interest in property that is equivalent in value to an increase in value of the whole or a portion of an interest in property for the purpose of paragraph (b) of the definition of "proceeds of unlawful activity" in the Act.

(2)If the value of the whole or a portion of an interest in property is increased directly or indirectly as a result of unlawful activity, the interest in property that is equivalent in value to this increase is determined in accordance with the following formula:

A =	B
C
where
A	=	the whole or the portion of the interest in property that is equivalent in value;
B	=	the dollar value of a payment or other benefit that increases or causes an increase in the value of the whole or portion of an interest in property;
C	=	the fair market value of the property in respect of which a payment or benefit referred to in the numerator was made or given on the date the payment is made or benefit is given.
(3)In this section, "fair market value" includes the increase in value resulting from the payment or benefit referred to in the definition of C in subsection (2).

(4)If 2 or more payments or 2 or more benefits referred to in subsection (2) increase the value of the whole or a portion of an interest in property, the whole or portion of the interest in property that is proceeds is the sum of each product calculated under subsection (2).

[am. B.C. Reg. 151/2024, Sch., s. 2.]

Equivalent value if decrease in debt obligation
3   (1)The purpose of this section is to determine the interest in property that is equivalent in value to a decrease in a debt obligation that is secured against the whole or a portion of an interest in property for the purpose of paragraph (c) of the definition of "proceeds of unlawful activity" in the Act.

(2)If a debt obligation secured against the whole or a portion of an interest in property is decreased directly or indirectly as a result of unlawful activity, the interest in property that is equivalent in value is determined in accordance with the following formula:

A =	B
C
where
A	=	the whole or the portion of the interest in property that is equivalent in value;
B	=	the dollar value of a payment that decreases a debt obligation secured against the whole or a portion of an interest in property, whether or not the payment reduces the principal, interest, or principal and interest of the debt obligation;
C	=	the fair market value of the property, against which the debt obligation referred to in the numerator is secured, on the date the payment decreases that debt obligation.
(3)If 2 or more payments reduce a debt obligation referred to in subsection (2), the whole or portion of the interest in property secured by the debt obligation that is proceeds is the sum of each product calculated under subsection (2).
