How to calculate the actual value of land — British Columbia Ferry Services Inc.
6  For a taxation year, the actual value of land that is part of a restricted-use property referred to in section 5 is one of the following amounts, as applicable:

(a)if, for the taxation year, the area of the land is smaller than the area of land that was part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for the previous taxation year, the amount determined in accordance with the following formula:

actual value =		current area
previous area	× PAV		× adjustment factor
where
current area	=	the area of the land that is part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year;
previous area	=	the area of land that was part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for the previous taxation year;
PAV	=	the actual value, as set out on the assessment roll for the previous taxation year, of the area of land that was part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for that previous taxation year;
adjustment factor	=	the adjustment factor for the property class in which the land that is part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year is classified for that taxation year;
(b)in any other case, the amount determined in accordance with the following formula:

actual value = (PAV × adjustment factor) + new land value

where

adjustment factor	=	the adjustment factor for the property class in which the land that is part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year is classified for that taxation year;
new land value	=	the actual value, determined for the taxation year, in accordance with the Act, of the land that is part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year but that was not part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for the previous taxation year.

How to calculate the actual value of improvements — British Columbia Ferry Services Inc.
7   (1)For a taxation year, the actual value of the improvements or parts of the improvements that are part of a restricted-use property referred to in section 5 is the amount determined in accordance with the following formula:

actual
value	=			PAV
continuing	−	PAV
former	− depreciation		×	adjustment
factor		+	new
improvement
value
where
PAV continuing	=	subject to subsection (4), the actual value, determined for the previous taxation year, of all of the improvements, or parts of them, that were part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for that previous taxation year and that continue to be part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year;
PAV former	=	the actual value, determined for the previous taxation year, of all of the improvements, or parts of them, that were part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for that previous taxation year but that are not part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year;
depreciation	=	the amount determined for the taxation year, in accordance with subsections (2) and (3), in relation to the designated restricted-use property;
adjustment factor	=	the adjustment factor for the property class in which all of the improvements, or parts of them, that are part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year are classified for the taxation year;
new improvement value	=	subject to subsection (4), the actual value, determined in accordance with the Act, for the taxation year, of all of the improvements, or parts of them, that are part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year but that were not part of the restricted-use property when it was designated for the previous taxation year.
(2)For the purposes of applying the formula set out in subsection (1), depreciation for a taxation year is, in relation to a designated restricted-use property, the total of all amounts each of which is an amount of depreciation applicable to an improvement or part of an improvement that is part of the designated restricted-use property, determined as follows:

(a)in the case of a berth improvement or part of a berth improvement, the amount that is equal to 3% of the replacement cost of the improvement or part;

(b)in the case of any other improvement or part of an improvement, the amount of depreciation, if any, determined by the assessor under section 19 (3) of the Act.

(3)Despite subsection (2) (a), the maximum amount of depreciation applicable to a berth improvement or part of a berth improvement for a taxation year is the amount that is equal to 60% of the replacement cost of the improvement or part.

(4)For the purposes of applying the formula set out in subsection (1) for the first taxation year following the completion of construction of a new single berth or double berth that is part of a designated restricted-use property referred to in section 5,

(a)the item in the formula described as PAV continuing must be reduced by the actual value, determined for the previous taxation year, of the berth improvements or parts of the berth improvements forming part of the new berth, and

(b)the item in the formula described as new improvement value must include the following amount, as applicable, as if none of the berth improvements or parts of the berth improvements forming part of the new berth had been part of the restricted-use property when it was designated for the previous taxation year:

(i)in the case of a single berth, $640 000;

(ii)in the case of a double berth, $2 700 000.

How to calculate the actual value of land — NAV CANADA
9  For a taxation year, the actual value of land that is part of a restricted-use property referred to in section 8 is one of the following amounts, as applicable:

(a)if, for the taxation year, the area of the land is smaller than the area of land that was part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for the previous taxation year, the amount determined in accordance with the following formula:

actual value =		current area
previous area	× PAV		× adjustment factor
where

PAV	=	the actual value, as set out on the assessment roll for the previous taxation year, of the area of land that was part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for that previous taxation year;
adjustment factor	=	the adjustment factor for the property class in which the land that is part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year is classified for that taxation year;

continuing	−	PAV
former	− depreciation		×	adjustment
factor		+	new
improvement
value
where
PAV continuing	=	the actual value, determined for the previous taxation year, of all of the improvements, or parts of them, that were part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for that previous taxation year and that continue to be part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year;
PAV former	=	the actual value, determined for the previous taxation year, of all of the improvements, or parts of them, that were part of the restricted-use property when the property was designated for that previous taxation year but that are not part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year;
depreciation	=	the amount determined for the taxation year, in accordance with subsection (2), in relation to the designated restricted-use property;
adjustment factor	=	the adjustment factor for the property class in which all of the improvements, or parts of them, that are part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year are classified for the taxation year;
new improvement value	=	the actual value, determined in accordance with the Act, for the taxation year, of all of the improvements, or parts of them, that are part of the designated restricted-use property for the taxation year but that were not part of the restricted-use property when it was designated for the previous taxation year.
(2)For the purposes of applying the formula set out in subsection (1), depreciation for a taxation year is, in relation to a designated restricted-use property, the total of all amounts each of which is an amount of depreciation applicable to an improvement or part of an improvement that is part of the designated restricted use property, determined by the assessor under section 19 (3) of the Act.
